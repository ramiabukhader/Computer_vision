RNN is a type of neural networks used for time series data analysis with internal loop
RNN processes sequences by iterating through the sequence elements, and it maintains a state containing info relative to what it has seen so far.
RNN is a loop that reuses quantities computed during the previous iteration of the loop.
The activation function used for RNN is Tanh(). it used for RNN because its range from -1 to 1 (logistic sigmoid).
RNN takes inputs of shape (batch_size, timesteps, input_features) or (batch_size, output_features) and both models controlled by the return_sequences.
