Sequential model has exactly one input and one output and consists of a linear stack of layers
	as seen in the previous examples.
This assumption becamse inflexible for some models that require independent inputs, multiple
	outputs or models that have branching between layers such as graphs of layers.

1. Multi input models: this works by merging the data coming from different input sources and
	processing each type of this data using different types of neural layers.

Examples of Multi input models: Predicting the price of old painting, it has Meta data, Text description
	and Pictures or paintings.
	This example requires:
	Meta data ---> one hot encoding + dense NN
	Text --> RNN
	Picture --> CNN or 2D convnetowrk
	by merging the modules, we can let the model learn jointly
2. Multi output models: 
	example: Classify genre based on text and predict the date of the story
	- For a short story --> identify its type (romance, comedy etc..)
	Generating Genre and Date means that the model has two outputs.

To solve this, we need a graph networks. that processing the inputs by several Conv branches 
	whose outputs are then merged back into a single tensor (Developed at google and called
	Inception family of networks). or adding residual connections to a model ( from Microsoft 
	called ResNet family of networks).

So Functional API is the use of layers as functions that take sensors and return sensors (sensors 
	manipulation). Tensors calling each others in the network.
